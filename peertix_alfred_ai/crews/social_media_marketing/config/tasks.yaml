    Focus on creating a message that resonates with the product target audience and highlights the topics around the product's unique selling points. You must not make sales post since the product is not yet launch, talk about the problems it aims to solve. If you can, do not even mention the product directly, only indirectly. An example instagram post could look like that: A "How was the concert?" - asks a friend, who couldn't attend. Just imagine if there was a platform where you could share and rate your experience for all your buddies to see. Share setlists, photos, and memories in a like-minded community. PeerTix is building that platform. Let's amplify the concert experience together! What was your latest concert experience like? Out of five? . Another example could be: It is so hard to find genuine new faces in music, even with todays heated social media and other viral platforms. Smaller artists, or others from the same genre having a hard time doing their discovery, a platform that behaves like a market maker between the smaller artists and the genuinely interested people could do the trick. The focus should be around the features, the problems, that the product has answers, without directly mentioning or recommending the product. It should not feel like a sale's pitch!
    
    Your post drafts must be attention-grabbing and should encourage viewers to join the product's community take action, whether it's visiting the website, following on social media, or learning more about the product.
